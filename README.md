# Restaurant Reviewer



You will develop a restaurant review application with a focus on accessibility. You will remotely access JSON files containing restaurant information (including name, a photograph, address, cuisine type and operating hours) as well as JSON files containing review information for each restaurant (name of reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating and comments). The reviews application must include an application header, and a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants (by cuisine, by location, etc). When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.
